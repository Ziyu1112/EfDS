# Projects, git, github intro

## Further tasks to practice

The primary goal is to exchange through a repository some files with a colleague.  
Please find one or two colleagues for this practice.  

You:

- In your GitHub account you need to have a new empty repository.
- In GitHub, in the repository: add the colleague(s) as collaborators.
- Add to the repository a Python notebook file with solutions of some of the Python tasks.  
    (Be sure that in the added file all Python cells do not have output below them. Clean all output before saving and committing the file to the repository.)
- Check that the newest version of the file is present in the GitHub web interface.

A colleague:

- Confirm that you now see the content of the shared repository.
- `git clone` the repository to your computer. Go to the repository working directory.
- Open the Python notebook file and try to understand the solutions of the tasks. Add some comments to the file.
- Use `git add` and `git commit` to store the changed version of the file in your local repository.
- Use `git push` to send the newest state of your local repository to the shared GitHub repository.
- Check that in GitHub webpages you see the newest changes.

You:

- Check that in GitHub webpages you see the newest changes.
- `git pull` the repository to your computer.
- Modify, `git add`, `git commit` and `git push`...
